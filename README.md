# BattCap
A project to design and easily print a protective cap for Nissan LEAF Gen 3/4 Battery modules for use in non-standard applications. 

This project came about because I purchased some second-hand Nissan LEAF AESC modules that were originally used not in a Nissan LEAF, but in a FreeWire portable charging station. While LEAF-spec cells, they didn't have the usual Nissan interconnect between moduels, and instead use a custom 250-amp capable multi-layer board by a company called TeckQuest. 

This is my attempt to build a cap to fit over those boards and the battery terminals, protecting the cells (and the end user) from accidental shorts. Designed in Fusion 360 (very badly, by first attempt) and printed on a BambuLab X1C. 

You'll see there's some text on the bottom left side of the lid. These reference the pinouts of the 5-port Micro-Fit breakout box on the Teck≈íuest board - but when everything is good on this end, I'll remove that text to make a standard LEAF version.
